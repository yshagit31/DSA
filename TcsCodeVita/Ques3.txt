Arrange Map
Problem Description
You were given a task of laying track between two stations. Since the plan is big to cover in single sheet, the whole project is drawn into several sheets.

You drew the position where the tracks are going to be laid. Initially, you arranged the sheets to create the complete plan, but discovered they were not in the correct order.

The complete plan is a square of size N x N, while each individual sheet measures M x M. Both the full plan and the individual sheets are always square in shape.

For example, consider a complete plan of size 6*6.

LLLLLL

LSTTTL

LLLLTL

LLLLTL

LLLLDL

LLLLLL

The L represents land, S and D the stops between which the track must be laid. T represents the track.

Assume its drawn with 3*3 sheets, the individual sheet be like
LLL LLL LLL LTL

LST TTL LLL LDL

LLL LTL LLL LLL

Since the map is unarranged, the entire plan may also be reconstructed as follows:
LLLLLL

LSTLLL

LLLLLL

LLLLTL

TTLLDL

LTLLLL

You are now tasked with rearranging the individual sheets to create a complete plan that ensures a continuous track between point S and point D. It is specified that the individual sheet containing "S" will always be positioned in the top left corner, while the sheet with "D" will always be in the bottom right corner. In the input, they will be in the same place. After rearranging, the distance between S and D should be the shortest.

The track cannot run over the edges of the individual sheets. That is,
LLL
TLL
TTL

is not valid.

Rearrange the map and return the shortest distance through track between the S and D. D is included in the distance calculation.

Note: Extra tracks will be present, that may not be part of path between S and D.

Constraints
6 <= N <= 25

3 <= M <= 5

Input
First line consists of two space separated integers representing N and M, i.e., whole plan and individual sheet sizes, respectively

Next N lines contain N space separated characters either L, T, S, D representing the misarranged plan.

Output
Print single integer representing the shortest distance along the track between S and D.

Time Limit (secs)

Explanation

The example is same as the one explained in description section, the shortest distance between S and D after arrangement will be 6.

Explanation

From the input it is seen that, the full plan of 6*6 and individual sheet of 3*3

The individual sheet are
LLL LLL LLL LTL

LST TTT TTL LDL

LLL LLL LTL LLL

Here the sheets will be represented by the index they present above in order 1 to 4. The sheets 1, 4 containing S and D will be at (0,0) and (1,1). If sheet 2 is placed at (0,1), since its continuous after (0,0) but it is not connecting anything further, ending abruptly, so the sheet 3 will be placed at (0,1) and thus D in (1,1) also connected. Below represents the complete plan

Thus, the shortest distance is 6. Hence, print the same.
