// Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Multiple Transaction Allowed

// The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

// Note: Buying and selling the stock can be done multiple times, but you can only hold one stock at a time. In order to buy another stock, firstly you have to sell the current holding stock.

// Examples:

// Input: prices[] = [3, 4, 1, 5]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We can buy stock on day 1 (at price 3) and sell it on day 2 (at price 4) profit will be 4 - 3 = 1, 
// We can buy another stock on day 3 (at price 1) and sell it on day 4 (at price 5) profit will be 5 - 1 = 4, 
// which will give us maximum profit of 1 + 4 = 5.
// Input: prices[] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: We can buy stock on day 1 (at price 1) and sell it on day 5 (at price 9), which will give us maximum profit of 8.
// Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

// Constraints:
// 1 <= prices.size() <= 105
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 104


// approach 1 if the profit in incoming stock is there add it to profit
